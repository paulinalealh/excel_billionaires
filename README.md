## The World's Billionaires 

In this Excel project, I analyze data on the world's billionaires, according to Forbes. 
Lots of standardizing for this one. I also created the Age_Bracket and Continent categories for better visualizations.
From this exploration, I conclude that most billionaires are in the Tech, Infrastructure and Finance Industries. The ones highest average Net Worth belongs to Seniors. Additionally, Asia, America and Europe have a higher concentration of billionaires than the rest of the world.


Thank you for reading!
